### dc analysis

* EF_R2RVC02_dc_op.spice is used to calculate the DC power consumption 
* EF_R2RVC02_dc_sweep_vinp_vinm.spice is used to calculate the maximum power consumption whenever sweeping both terminals of the comparator
* EF_R2RVC02_dc_sweep_vinp.spice is used to calculate the comparator's offset

* ### tran analysis

* EF_R2RVC02_tran_ramp_functionality.spice and EF_R2RVC02_tran_sin_functionality.spice are used to test the functionality of the comparator
